			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
               <b>Animal Welfare</b>. 
                  I am an avid animal lover and vegan. In my spare time I enjoy spoiling my two cats and volunteering
                  with shelters and animal advocacy groups. Unfortunately, due to COVID 19 this has not been something
                  I've been able to participate in since moving to Maine in August 2020.

				  <b>Music</b>.
                  Growing up I learned to play the piano and guitar, but today I am more of a music consumer than
                  creator. I love spending time discovering new artists, collecting vinyls, and attending shows. My
                  favorite band of all time is Green Day; I've seen them perform on the east coast, west coast, and in
                  Spain.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Sports</b>.
                  Living an active lifestyle is important to me. I enjoy trying new things such as yoga, group fitness
                  classes, and martial arts. In 2021, I founded the Portland West End Running Club, a group that meets 
                  around Portland, Maine several times a week for group runs and events.
                  Born and raised in Massachusetts, I am a loyal Boston sports fan.
