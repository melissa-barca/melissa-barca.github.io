                I am a life long learner. I enjoy digging in and picking apart new concepts and technologies to make
                sense of them from start to finish. What I love about the software industry is that it's always striving
                to be better and improve on itself; which is something I prioritize in my professional and personal
                life.

                I am passionate about programming, puzzles, and problem solving and enjoy using these passions to make
                people's lives easier. I take pleasure in creating solutions that can eliminate stress and pressure
                points in user's day to day work and life. I've found the best solutions come from brainstorming with a
                team of subject experts and engineers. Collaboration is a key part of any successful project.

                Currently I'm working at RStudio to help build, improve on, and support the RStudio IDE.
