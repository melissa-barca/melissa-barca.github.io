                I am a life long learner. I enjoy digging in and picking apart new concepts and technologies to make
                sense of them from start to finish. What I love about the software industry is that it's always striving
                to be better and improve on itself; which is something I prioritize in my professional and personal
                life.

                I am passionate about programming, puzzles, and problem solving and enjoy using these passions to make
                people's lives easier. I take pleasure in working directly with clients to create solutions that can
                eliminate stress and pressure points in their day to day work and life. I've found the best solutions
                come from brainstorming with a team of subject experts and developers. Collaboration is a key part of
                any successful development project.

                Currently I'm working at RStudio to help build, improve on, and support the RStudio IDE.
